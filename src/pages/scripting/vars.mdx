# Vars tab

**Vars** tab allows you to set variables:
 - before request and
 - after you receive the response.

Variables are scoped within the request and cannot be accessed outside of it.

> Note: Prior to v1.20.0, request vars were accessible at the collection scope, but this is no longer the case.

In the **Vars** tab > **Pre Request** variables section, you can write any strings, numbers or any valid JavaScript literal.

In the **Vars** tab > **Post Response** variables section, you can write any valid JavaScript expression. The `res` object is available, allowing you to declaratively parse the [response object](/scripting/response/response-object) and set variables, instead of writing scripts to do the same.

For parsing the response, you can checkout the [response query](/scripting/response/response-query) that allows you to easily query your response.
